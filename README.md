# QueryReformulator using TensorForce

QueryReformulator is based on Deep Reinforcement Learning. It is an implementation using tensorforce library.

The original paper is:

- [Paper: Task-Oriented Query Reformulation with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04572)

- [Slides](https://github.com/nyu-dl/QueryReformulator/blob/master/Slides.pdf)

Originally it is the project for UIUC(MCS-DS) CS410 course. As a team, this repository is just one implementation of our project,

another implementation is located at https://github.com/YifanTian/tensorforce_QR.

The lastest design document can be found at https://docs.google.com/document/d/10HiHWQJoQcBINGntWygAGJAYGHSVVygZz8eyetWnyHE/

## Dependencies

To run the code, you will need:
* Python 2.7
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [scikit learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)
* [Theano 0.9 or higher](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/)
* [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/)
* [h5py](http://www.h5py.org/)
* [PyLucene 6.2 or higher](http://lucene.apache.org/pylucene/)

We recommend that you have at least 32GB of RAM. If you are going to use a GPU, the card must have at least 6GB.
